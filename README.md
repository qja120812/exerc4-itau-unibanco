## üìù Code Explanation
The code in this repository has been refactored to adhere to each of the SOLID principles:
1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - Each class has a single responsibility, making it easier to manage and maintain.
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - The code is open for extension but closed for modification, promoting scalability and flexibility.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - Subclasses can be substituted for their base classes without affecting the functionality of the program.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - Interfaces are fine-tuned for specific clients, ensuring that no client is forced to depend on methods it does not use.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations, promoting decoupling and ease of testing.
